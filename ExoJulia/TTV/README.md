This directory contains software and links for the
analysis of transit timing variations:

1). TTVFaster:  this gives an analytic formula for two planets
to first-order in mass ratio and eccentricity for any period
ratio (Agol & Deck 2016), and to second order near second order
resonance (Deck & Agol 2016).  These formulae are only valid
for small massess, small eccentricites, out of resonance, and
for nearly plane-parallel planets.

2). TTVFast:  (TODO: translate ttvfast from C, or write a C
wrapper).
